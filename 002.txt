Subscribe  Article Text : .article-text  Ford recently  made an announcement  that could change the world as we know it. The company’s public broadcast about the future of the company’s automobiles left consumers stunned and hungry for more information. The new vehicles have a few things missing—steering wheels, gas pedals, and brakes, for starters—and one prominent shift for the automotive world: The vehicles are completely autonomous. Tracking The Shift Toward Autonomous Travel This bold shift in the way our civilization travels is something the modern world has only imagined; it’s the way George Orwell so creatively (albeit quite accurately) portrayed our world in  1984.  Just as Orwell predicted surveillance technology, mass advertisements, speech-to-text software, and missile detection systems, so has the sci-fi fantasy of a self-driven car become a reality. Autonomous cars are difficult to wrap one’s mind around—not just the technology that makes them possible, but what this means for our future. Ford states that it will ship self-driving cars by 2021. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the carmaker learned from Kodak’s mistake, which  missed the opportunity  to transform from a traditional film company to a digital film company that would embrace mobility. By endeavoring to evolve, Ford marked itself as a company of the future, not of the past. This distinction is the type of mindset that can ensure the future relevance of a company. Ford’s bold shift in the automotive industry positions itself as  the  car company to beat. As incredible as this announcement seems, is it really so unexpected? Not in my book. Since the fervor of mobile took over the world, a global concern has been the mounting death toll attributed to people using their mobile devices behind the wheel. Many people guilty of this dangerous habit blame their busy lives and the push to always be  doing —even while driving. Mobility has been the buzzword of the 21st century. Autonomous travel falls in line with our push toward total mobility, enabling us to work, eat, sleep, and more on our daily commute in the privacy of our own vehicles. A car that safely drives itself and that can react to the environment and real-time roadway hazards could be society’s answer to solving accidents caused by distractions and human error. An autonomous vehicle is the ideal solution. It’s not only  predicted to save 300,000 lives per decade , but it will also enable us to, literally, work on the go. Realize The Reality Of Ford’s Announcement It’s easy to get caught up in the idea of a self-driving car and imagine a 2021 where everyone is driving (or rather,  not  driving) an autonomous vehicle. However, don’t expect a major change within the next five years. Ford isn’t the only car manufacturer approaching success with a self-driving vehicle;  Tesla was in the picture  long before the big announcement, and BMW is apparently on the same timeline as Ford, with its own car scheduled for market in 2021 as well. Ford is pushing into the full adoption market in an attempt to be the frontrunner. When a major company makes a commitment to a future market, it is a huge deal for the industry.
