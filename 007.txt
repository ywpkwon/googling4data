					 REALITY CHECK Fully autonomous vehicles won't arrive for a long time October 10, 2016 @ 12:01 am Comments Email Richard Truett

Hardly a week passes without some announcement from automakers, suppliers -- even ride-hailing services -- about the impending arrival of self-driving cars.  But experts say a fully automated vehicle that is 100 percent safe 100 percent of the time and can operate on any street in any weather condition in the U.S. is not right around the corner.  It's a decade or more down the road.  That assessment, from Raj Rajkumar, co-director of the General Motors-Carnegie Mellon Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab, is shared by other experts at other schools and elsewhere. Carnegie Mellon, the crucible of autonomous vehicle technology, has been working on self-driving vehicles since the 1980s.  The obstacles to perfecting and mass producing fully automated vehicles that can safely transport a passenger door-to-door with no human intervention are formidable: Sensing equipment, such as cameras, lidar and radar, has to get more efficient, especially in inclement weather. It also must get less expensive.  Software has to be perfected that links the vehicle's controls with all the sensing hardware. And this software must be able to anticipate nearly every scenario a vehicle can encounter, from inclement weather to a traffic cop's hand signals to a pedestrian darting into traffic.   Infrastructure needs to be improved, from lane markings to traffic signals to bridges -- as well as the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems. For a vehicle to drive itself safely in all conditions and speeds, it has to know where it is at all times so that, for example, it anticipates a stop sign around a corner. Tech with "common sense'? "We as humans have common sense and reasoning powers that we apply, and most of the time, if not always, we do the right thing," said Rajkumar. "Computers, though very powerful, are unfortunately lacking in common sense.  "Self-driving cars can only do what programmers tell them to do. They can't anticipate everything that can happen on the road."  Communication from automakers also can be confusing. Few automakers are promising a fully autonomous vehicle, classified as a Level 5 vehicle by SAE International. But some marketing names, such as Tesla's Autopilot, give the impression that cars with limited autonomous technology can drive themselves safely at all times.  Consumers also might not notice some of the qualifications in automakers' forecasts.  For instance, in August, Ford CEO Mark Fields said by 2021 his company aims to be making a self-driving car that eliminates the pedals and steering wheel. But this vehicle would be a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, to be used only in certain areas and conditions. Fields said that Ford's car would be used by ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in a geo-fenced area, which means it would be limited to streets that have been mapped and programmed into the vehicle's software.  Such an area could be the small part of Pittsburgh where Uber is testing self-driving cars this fall, or a closed area such as the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Mich., where automated Chevy Volts will be used to transport GM engineers this year. Toyoda: More testing Ford's ambitious claim -- and others like it -- has some doubters.  Last month at the Paris auto show, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said fully autonomous driving, which the company calls chauffer mode, will require lengthy validation.

■ Ford "We're dedicated to putting on the road an autonomous vehicle that can improve safety and solve social and environmental challenges for millions of people - not just those who can afford luxury vehicles." -- Ford CEO Mark Fields COMPILED BY JACK WALSWORTH Toyoda: A long way to achieve chauffeur mode "In order to accomplish this safely, it is estimated that some 14.2 billion kilometers [8.8 billion miles] of testing, including simulation, are required," Toyoda said.  Adrian Lund, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute, told  Automotive News  that getting to Level 4 in five years is possible. But to do it without a steering wheel and pedals would be "a hard nut to crack." A car with no steering wheel or pedals would make it a Level 5 automated vehicle. That's at least 10 years away, he said. Citing the fatal May 7 Tesla Model S crash in Florida, Lund said he believes crash avoidance technology needs much more work to be ready for Level 4 automated driving by 2021. Tesla told investigators that a "technical failure" in the car's automatic braking system was partially to blame for the accident.  "Part of the problem is if you think about getting to Level 4, that implies that the crash avoidance technology you have in these cars is almost perfect," he said.  Lund believes accidents are not going to cease when self-driving cars are on the roads. "These vehicles are going to have crashes, at least during a long transition period of when we have all types of vehicles on the road," he said.  Huei Peng, director of the University of Michigan's Mobility Transformation Center, says self-driving technology is maturing quickly and that more automated driving features are coming soon. But it may be decades before a vehicle can drive itself safely at any speed on any road in any weather. Safer than humans Peng said he sees Level 4 automated driving at low speeds in good weather happening by 2021.  "I would argue that if you just talk about technology and reasonable operating conditions," Peng said, "we can almost say we have systems that are safer than human drivers." He cited Google's self-driving car fleet, which has logged more than 2 million autonomous miles and caused just one minor accident.  The Google test fleet operates 58 vehicles in four states.  "Robots always work best when they have rules," Peng says. "What if other people are not following the rules? In the truest sense, Level 5 autonomous vehicles will take a very long time."
